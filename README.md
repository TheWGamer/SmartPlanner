# SmartPlanner

This is a redesign of a program I wrote about a year ago.  It was initally written in (admittedly bad) c++, and I am not redesigning it from the ground up in C with a lot more knowledge and insight.  The program is a rather simple console application where one can keep track of their finances.  It is rather simple, but has so far been a fantastic exercise for developing my skills as a C programmer.
